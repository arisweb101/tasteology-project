# Tasteology Project

Tasteology is a web application that focuses on the science of cooking and food colours. It includes various images that can be displayed in modals, with content extracted from a Figma design. The app is fully responsive and works down to a 320px mobile device, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile.

## Features

-   **Image Modals**: Click on any image to open it in a modal.
-   **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when they are about to enter the viewport.
-   **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout, optimized for mobile devices (320px and up).
-   **Smooth Animations**: Visual animations on elements like titles and images for an engaging user experience.
-   **Custom Hover Effects**: Hover brightness effects are implemented to all images.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: Structure and content of the web pages.
-   **SCSS/CSS**: Styling, with a modular approach using SCSS.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For interactive features and animations.
-   **Webpack**: Bundling and transpiling assets.
-   **Lozad.js**: Lazy loading for images.
-   **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler that allows using the latest ES features.
-   **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code to make code more consistent and avoid bugs.
-   **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project.
-   **Google Fonts**: For custom fonts (Open Sans).

## Approach: Using Vanilla JavaScript

1. **Simplicity**: Using plain JavaScript ensures a straightforward and minimalistic approach to the project. This makes it easier to understand and debug without introducing additional complexities.
2. **Performance**: A smaller, framework-free project tends to have better performance because thereâ€™s no overhead of additional libraries or frameworks.

If this project were to be implemented using React or Vue, I would be able to adapt to those frameworks as well. The principles and skills I used here are transferable to modern JavaScript frameworks, allowing for flexibility in how the project could be approached.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

-   Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or later).
-   Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js).

### Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arisweb101/tasteology-project.git

    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd tasteology
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Build the project:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

Visit the homepage to see the layout and interact with the images.

Click on any image to open it in a modal.

The app is fully responsive, so try resizing the browser window or testing on mobile devices.

Additionally, the images in the project have been optimized for faster loading and better performance.

I hope you like it. Thank you!
